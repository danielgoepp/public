# My public repository

I hope to migrate most of my work to this repository ultimately, but right now it is very limited. I'm just starting with the scripts I just built to integrate IoTaWatt with VictoriaMetrics. I need to start running through my scripts and k8s configs to clean them up before I feel they are publicly presentable.
